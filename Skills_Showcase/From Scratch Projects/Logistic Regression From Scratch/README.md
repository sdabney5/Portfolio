**TLDR:** 

 - This is a Logistic Regression Algorithm written from scratch without the use of libraries, including Numpy. 
 - I explain the math involved and compare results of my algo to sklearn on a dataset.

## Project Overview: 
The "Logistic Regression From Scratch" Jupyter Notebook walks through each step of Logistic Regression and explains the math behind it. 
The Logistic_Regression_Class is the python script.
