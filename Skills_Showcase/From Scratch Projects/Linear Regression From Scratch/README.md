# Linear Regression From Scratch

**TLDR:** 

 - This is a Linear Regression Algorithm written from scratch without the use of libraries, including Numpy. 
 - I explain the math involved and compare results of my algo to sklearn on a dataset.

## Project Overview: 
The " Regression From Scratch" Jupyter Notebook walks through each step of Linear Regression and explains the math behind gradient descent. 
The Linear_Regression_Class is the python script. 
The "Linear_Regression_Comparison_Notebook" compares results using m
