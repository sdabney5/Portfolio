# Linear Regression From Scratch
 This is a Linear Regression Algorithm written from scratch
   
 ---

## Project Overview: 

In this project, I developed a linear regression function from scratch, without relying on any Python libraries. Although some libraries, especially numpy, could make the code more efficient and less cumbersome, this approach demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanics of linear regression.  
  
The project consists of three main components:

- A Jupyter Notebook, "Linear Regression from Scratch," which provides a detailed walkthrough of my linear regression project.
- A Python script, "Linear_Regression_Class," which contains the code for the linear regression algorithm.
- Another Jupyter Notebook, "Linear Regression Comparison," which compares the results of my algorithm with those of the SKLearn library on the same dataset.
