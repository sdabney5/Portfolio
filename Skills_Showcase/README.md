# Skills Showcase

These projects were done primarily as an exploration of the inner workings of each algorithm in depth. Secondarily, I think they showcase both an understanding of the algorithms as well as skills in algorithm development.

Where necessary, I have taken a deep dive into the mathematical principles and concepts that underlie each algorithm, building my understanding from the ground up. Through this process I've gained a deep appreciation for the intricacies of each algorithm.

Thanks for checking these out!

**Color_Palette_Extractor**  
Color Palette Extractor uses KMeans Clustering as well as some novel functions to get extract a color palette from an image.
This directory contains the python script and an explanatory Jupyter Notebook. 
The Applied_Skills_Projects directory contains a project that utilizes this script.
