# Practical Projects  

This directory contains two Python projects:

## Color Palette Extractor  
- Color Palette Extractor is a Python program that automatically generates a color palette for a given image. The program uses K Means Clustering to get the dominant colors of the image and extracts small splashes of contrasting colors which should be in the color palette. The code for this project is in the Color Palette Extractor folder.

## Famous Paintings Color Data  
- Famous Paintings Color Data is a Python project that uses web scraping and data visualization to extract color palette information from a list of famous paintings. The project uses Beautiful Soup to scrape painting data from the web, and uses my color_palette_extractor script to extract the color palettes of each painting. The resulting CSV file contains color palette information for each of the paintings, including hex values for the color palette, the image category, and unique contrasting color hex value (if present). The CSV file is included in this directory as well.
