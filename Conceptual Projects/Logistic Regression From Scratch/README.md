# Logistic Regression From Scratch

This directory contains the Logistic_Regression_Class.py file, which implements logistic regression from scratch using Python. 


In addition to the implementation code, this directory also contains an explanatory Jupyter notebook (Logistic_Regression_From_Scratch_Notebook.ipynb) that discusses the theory behind logistic regression and the math involved in the algorithm.

Thanks for checking out this project.
