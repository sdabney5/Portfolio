# Logistic Regression From Scratch

## Overview:
This project was the natural next steo after my Linear Regression From Scratch project. Here, as in the previous project, I developed a Logistic Regression class from scratch, without relying on any Python libraries. Although some libraries, especially numpy, could make the code more efficient and less cumbersome, this approach demonstrates a more thorough understanding of the underlying mechanics of logistic regression.

This directory contains:
- Logistic_Regression_Class.py  
  Implements logistic regression from scratch using Python. 

- Logistic_Regression_From_Scratch_Notebook.ipynb  
Discusses the theory behind logistic regression and the math involved in the algorithm.

Thanks for checking out this project.
