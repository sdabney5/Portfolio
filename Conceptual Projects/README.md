# Conceptual Projects
This directory contains several machine learning projects that I have built from scratch in python. 

### Algorithms
The following algorithms are included in this directory:

- Linear Regression  
- Logistic Regression
- K Nearest Neighbors
Each algorithm is contained within its own directory and includes a Python script that implements the algorithm as a class. The code should be easy to follow.

### Explainer Notebooks  
The Linear Regression and Logistic Regression directories also contain Jupyter notebooks that explain the math and theory behind the algorithms. These notebooks were created as a way for me to understand the algorithms better.  
  
### Linear Regression Performance Comparison  
The Linear Regression directory also contains a Jupyter notebook that compares the performance of my From-Scratch model to the model provided by Scikit-Learn. This notebook includes visualizations of the models' predictions and compares their mean absolute error and $R^2$ scores.
