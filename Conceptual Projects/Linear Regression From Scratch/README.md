# Linear Regression From Scratch
 Linear Regression Algorithm written from scratch with a Jupyter Notebook explaining the code. Also included is a project comparing the results of my algorithm to SKLearn's.

## Project Overview: 

In this project, I developed a linear regression class from scratch, without relying on any Python libraries. Although some libraries, especially numpy, could make the code more efficient and less cumbersome, this approach demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanics of linear regression.  
  
The project consists of three main components:

- "Linear Regression from Scratch," which provides a detailed walkthrough of my linear regression project.
- "Linear_Regression_Class," which contains the code for the linear regression algorithm.
- "Linear Regression Algorithm Comparison," which compares the results of my algorithm with those of the SKLearn library on the same dataset.
  
  
Thanks for taking the time to check out this project!
