# Shane Dabney Data Science Portfolio

This repository is a collection of my data science projects. There are two main directories: `Skills_Showcase` and `Applied_Skills_Projects`.

## Skills_Showcase

This directory contains projects where I built machine learning algorithms from scratch. These projects demonstrate my understanding of the underlying math and concepts behind each algorithm. The following algorithms are included:

1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. KNN (k-Nearest Neighbors)

Each folder contains the `.py` script for the respective algorithm. The Linear Regression folder also contains explanatory Jupyter Notebooks to provide a deeper understanding of the implementation.

## Applied_Skills_Projects

This directory contains projects that demonstrate my ability to apply various data science skills and techniques. The projects in this directory include:

1. Color Palette Extractor: A Python script that extracts color palettes from images. This project also includes an explanatory Jupyter Notebook that walks through the process and provides visualizations of the results.


  

Feel free to explore the projects and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions. Enjoy!
