# Shane Dabney Data Science Portfolio

This repository is a collection of my data science projects. There are two main directories:

<details>
  <summary><h2>Skills Showcase</h2></summary>

  The Skills Showcase directory contains several machine learning projects that I've built from scratch. These projects were done primarily as an exploration of the inner workings of each algorithm in depth. Secondarily, I think they showcase both an understanding of the algorithms, as well as my skills in algorithm development.

Where necessary, I have taken a deep dive into the mathematical principles and concepts that underlie each algorithm, building my understanding from the ground up. Through this process of exploration and discovery, I've gained a deep appreciation for the intricacies of each algorithm.

Thanks for checking these out!
 
  <details>
    <summary><h4>Linear Regression</h4></summary>
  
    Each folder contains the `.py` script for the respective algorithm. The Linear Regression folder also contains explanatory Jupyter Notebooks to provide a deeper understanding of the implementation.
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><h4>Logistic Regression</h4></summary>
  
    Each folder contains the `.py` script for the respective algorithm. The Logistic Regression folder also contains explanatory Jupyter Notebooks to provide a deeper understanding of the implementation.
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><h4>KNN (k-Nearest Neighbors)</h4></summary>
  
    Each folder contains the `.py` script for the respective algorithm. The KNN (k-Nearest Neighbors) folder also contains explanatory Jupyter Notebooks to provide a deeper understanding of the implementation.

<details>
  <summary><h2>Applied Skills Projects</h2></summary>

  This directory contains projects that demonstrate my ability to apply various data science skills and techniques. The projects in this directory include:

  <details>
    <summary><h4>Color Palette Extractor</h4></summary>
  
    A Python script that extracts color palettes from images. This project also includes an explanatory Jupyter Notebook that walks through the process and provides visualizations of the results.
