# Shane Dabney Data Science Portfolio

This repository is a collection of my data science projects. There are two main directories:

<details>
  <summary><h2>Skills Showcase</h2></summary>

  The Skills Showcase directory contains several machine learning projects that I've built from scratch. The following algorithms are included:  
  - Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
  - K Nearest Neighbors
 
 

<details>
  <summary><h2>Applied Skills Projects</h2></summary>

  This directory contains projects that demonstrate my ability to apply various data science skills and techniques.  The projects in this directory include:

  <details>
    <summary><h4>Color Palette Extractor</h4></summary>
  
    A Python script that extracts color palettes from images. This project also includes an explanatory Jupyter Notebook that walks through the process and provides visualizations of the results.
  </details>

Feel free to explore the projects and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions.
