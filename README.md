# Portfolio

This repository is a collection of my Data Science and Machine Learning projects. There are two main directories:

<details>
  <summary><h2>Conceptual Projects</h2></summary>

  The Conceptual Projects directory contains several machine learning projects, including algorithms that I've built from scratch. The following algorithms are included:  
  - Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
  - K Nearest Neighbors
